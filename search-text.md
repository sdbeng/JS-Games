#Search your name

##writing a short program that checks a block of text for your name.

Specifically, it will check the text for the first letter of your name, then push (add) the number of characters equal to your name's length to an array. By inspecting the array, you'll be able to see if your name was mentioned!

```
/*jshint multistr:true */

text = "Blah blah blah blah blah blah Eric \
blah blah blah Eric blah blah Eric blah blah \
blah blah blah blah blah Eric";

var myName = "Eric";
var hits = [];

// Look for "E" in the text
for(var i = 0; i < text.length; i++) {
	if (text[i] === "E") {
		// If we find it, add characters up to
		// the length of my name to the array
		for(var j = i; j < (myName.length + i); j++) {
			hits.push(text[j]);
		}
	}
}

if (hits.length === 0) {
	console.log("Your name wasn't found!");
} else {
	console.log(hits);
}
```
